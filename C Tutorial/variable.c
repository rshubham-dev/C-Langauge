    // variable is the name assigned to the data or on which we are storing the data.
    int num = 10; // here num the a variable which stores value of number 
    char star = "*"; // here star is the variable which stores value character
    int age = 20; // here age
    float pi = 3.14; // here pi is the variable which stores decimal value 

    // Rules of variable
    
    //1. Variables are case sensitive, example:
    int a = 10;
    int A = 10;
    // both variable have same value both both are different.

    //2. 1st character is alphabet or '_' (underscore) 
    int _age = 24;
    int age = 24;
    // int -age = 24; ( X )

    //3. no comma or blank space
     int final_price = 400;
     // int total score = 40; will be wrong

     //4. no other symbole other then '_' (underscore) should be use

     //5. variable should be named meaningful
     

     // Data Types

     //1. Char or signed char it use 1 bytes of data,
     //2. Unsigned char it use 1 bytes,
     //3. int or signed int it use 1 bytes
     //4. Unsigned int it use 1 bytes
     //5. Short int or unsigned short int it use 1 bytes
     //6. Signed short int it use 2 bytes,
     //7. Long int or signed long int it use 4 bytes,
     //8. Unsigned long int it use 4 bytes,
     //9. float it use 4 bytes
     //10. double it use 8 bytes,
     //11. Long double it use 10 bytes

     //1. int - Stores the integer value like - 1, 5, 10, ...
     int marks = 90;

     //2. float - Stores the decimal values like - 1.59, 98.45, 0.54, ...
     float pi = 3.14;

     //3. char - Stores the character values like - @, *, #, ...
     char hastag = "#";


     // Constants - Values that doesn't change

     // Types of constants :-
     //1. Integer Constants - 1, 2, 3, 0, -1, -2, -3, ...
     //2. Real constants - 1.0,2.0,3.14,-2.4
     //3. Character constants - 'a', 'b', 'A', '#', '&', all characters, upper case, lower case, special characters. Character constants are written in single quotes.
