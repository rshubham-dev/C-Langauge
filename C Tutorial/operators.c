/* 
a. Arithmetic operators - +, -, *, /, %
example :- 
int x = 2, y = 4;
int sum = x + y;
int multiply = x * y;
int divide = x / y;
int subtract = x - y;
% (modular) - It return remainder
printf("%d", x%y);

b. Relational operators - It tells the relation between two variable, like --> ==, >, >=, <, <=, !=


c. Logical operators - It is used to check the condition logical,
like --> && is AND, || is OR, ! is NOT
example:- printf("%d", 3>4 && 5>2);
example:- printf("%d", 3>4 || 5>2);


d. Bitwise operators,


e. Assignment operators - it is used to assign value
like --> =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=,


f. Ternary operator,
